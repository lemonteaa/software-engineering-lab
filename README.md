# Software Engineering Lab

This repo host a number of learning experiments on intersting Software Engineering "stuff" that I consider to be meso level: not pure theory like in Computer Science, and also not plain application like in Web Development.

The main goal is to have fun with the technologies, and secondarily to illustrate the gist of those ideas, by having simple implementations that can be read/understood at a glance.

Because of these goals, they are basically toy. I take no responsibility/liability if anyone is insane enough to take any code here straight to production - you may expect your server to blow up ;)

Further README is available inside the folder of respective subprojects/modules.
